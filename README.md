# Theoretical Performance (MVA) Calculation

This Project is a look into hand calculating MVAs and converting the steps required into an algorithm that can be coded and utilized to quickly calculate Response Time in different scenarios.

First, a Single Class CLosed MVA scenario is hand calculated and then turned into an algorithm and coded to quickly calculate Response Times.

Secondly, a Two-Class Closed MVA is coded and the Response Time of various scenarios is calculated.
